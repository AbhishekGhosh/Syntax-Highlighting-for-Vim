Syntax Highlighting for Vim OSX

Only the part for the text editor
=================================


Rest was discussed in details :
http://thecustomizewindows.com/2012/11/customize-iterm2-with-color-schemes-syntax-highlighting/

Why to
======

No Syntax highlighting when a file opened with Vim (vi) text editor inside iTerm2.


How to 
======


Open the webpage : https://github.com/AbhishekGhosh/Syntax-Highlighting-for-Vim/blob/master/vim-syntax.txt

Open iTerm2, and type :

cd /usr/share/vim

sudo vim vimrc

And copy paste that all text like things from that vim-syntax.txt file linked above. Use i to go in to insert mode to paste them. After pasting press Esc key. Then type :x and hit enter from keyboard. 
That is it. Open any HTML or some kind of file now...
